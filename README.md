# php-autoconfig-autodiscover

Generates a valid Autoconfig/Autodiscover messages for mail clients.

Usage
When mail clients are setup the first time, they'll try to connect to the subdomain autodiscover. of the respective mail domain to recieve their self-configuration information as an XML file. At a basic level, this includes things like mail server adresses for imap/pop and smtp servers, ports, SSL usage etc. Much more is possible though.
This script generates a valid autodiscover.xml or config-v1.1.xml files upon request, but inserts server information based on the email address. For example, if you own several vhosts, say, example.com, example.org, foo.com and bar.com. They all have subdomains for imap and smtp, like imap.example.com and smtp.example.com.
When setting up email accounts, it would be nice if the basic stuff would be automatically inserted - the mail servers, their ports, etc. That is exactly what this project does.

Setup
Put the "autoconfig" folder into your webroot. Set up a new subdomain (via Hosting control panel or as a vhost using your own webserver) for autodiscover.example.com.

Configuration
The least information neeeded to autoconfigure email clients is the mail service domains and ports: Inside of autodiscover.php you will find this code:

    // pop settings
    $popServer = 'pop.' . $domain; // pop.example.com
    $popPort = 110;
    $smtpSSL = false;
    
    // imap settings
    $imapServer = 'imap.' . $domain; // imap.example.com
    $imapPort = 993;
    $imapSSL = true;
    
    // smtp settings
    $smtpServer = 'smtp.' . $domain; // smtp.example.com
    $smtpPort = 587;
    $smtpSSL = true;
The variable $domain is populated with the domain from the request.

Debugging
If the client throws an error or is unable to retrieve the config, you can enable a debug log holding each individual http request by uncommenting line 20 in autodiscover.php.

Known problems
Outlook takes pretty long for servers without a valid SSL certificate, so make sure to get one
Apple Mail doesn't implement the autodiscover protocol correctly, if you depend on this client, you might need to fiddle with the response
